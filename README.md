# CPShell

A shell for the Classpad

## Installation

Firstly, clone the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/s3ansh33p/CPShell
cd CPShell
```
Make sure that you have python3 installed, then install the "Pillow" package
```bash
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install --upgrade Pillow
```
To convert the textures for the classpad, run the following python scripts.
```bash
python3 ./convert_textures.py
python3 ./convert_fonts.py
```
To compile the program, make sure that you have the [Hollyhock-2 SDK](https://github.com/SnailMath/hollyhock-2) istalled, with newlib.

Once the SDK is installed, compile the program.
```bash
make hhk
```
If you want to recompile you can run the following command.
```bash
make clean && make hhk
```

Now that the program is compiled, you will need to copy some files the classpad.

First, copy the fonts from `./res/CPShell/fnt` to `/usr/fonts/` on the classpad.

If there are existing files for `5x6` and `7x8` on the classpad, you will not need to copy those.

Secondly, copy the `./CPShell.hhk` to `/bin/CPShell.hhk` on the classpad.

## Classpad Structure

I have changed the structure of the classpad to clean things up.

Note that the classpad only supports folders that are 3 levels deep
(so `/fls0/A/B/C` would be accessible but not `/fls0/A/B/C/D`).
```
ðŸ“¦fls0 (flash root)
 â”£ ðŸ“‚bin (hhk programs)
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œCPShell.hhk
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œCPBoy.bin
 â”£ ðŸ“‚etc
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œrelease (plan to have files here for the Shell)
 â”£ ðŸ“‚usr (user data)
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚textures (for textures through Interchan's texture code)
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚ponggers2 (example)
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œball
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œball_trail
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚CPFlappyBird (example)
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œbackground
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œflappy0
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚fonts (for fonts through Interchan's texture code, in one folder as everything uses same fonts)
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œ5x6
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œ7x8
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚saves (for games and the CPBoy for example)
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚CPBoy
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œZelda
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“‚hhkengine
 â”ƒ â”ƒ   â”— ðŸ“œTest
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚CPBoy (also has other folders for custom stuff)
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚roms
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œZelda.gb
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“‚palettes
 â”ƒ â”ƒ   â”— ðŸ“œCustom 0.gb
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“‚xcp (actual classpad files)
 â”ƒ   â”— ðŸ“œbinomial.xcp
 â”— ðŸ“œrun.bin (loader for bin/hhk)
```

As a result, I have modified the hollyhock launcher itself so .hhk and .bin files are loaded from the `fls0/bin` directory, though if a user wishes to leave them in the root directory, they can.
